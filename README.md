# simultaneous cosparsity and low rank optimization: a demo for multi-structural compressed sensing
Classical compressive sensing only exploit the sparsity in one domain. A lot of biomedical signals have additional structures, such as multi-sparsity in different domains, piecewise smoothness, low rank matrix/ tensor, etc. We propose a framework to exploit all the available structure information. A new convex programming problem is generated with multiple convex structure-inducing constraints and the linear measurement fitting constraint. With additional a priori information for solving the underdetermined system, the signal recovery performance can be improved. In numerical experiments, we compare the proposed method with classical methods. Both simulated data and real-life biomedical data are used. Results show that the newly proposed method achieves better reconstruction accuracy performance in term of both L1 and L2 errors.
